Q1 - Proposal.
Problem Description
- What problem does your project solve?
Hunger. Recipes for dinner or even dessert.  
- How will your project solve this problem?
Will allow user to search for thousands of recipes in one place. Would like to add a calorie counter.
- What inputs does your project need?
One input to search for recipes.
- What outputs does your project produce, and how do they help solve the problem? This includes:
I would like for the output to display a picture of the finished meal or dessert, the title and description of each dish.
- Displays your program provides
At least 10 images per search of each meal or dessert that comes up.
- Graphs of user data
- Calculations your software makes
Would like to add nutritional value to content.
- Data analysis your software does
- External Data
    - What web API(s) or Internet of Things (IoT) devices will your project use? BE SPECIFIC about the exact API you are using by signing up and verifying that you can use that API. If you are using an IoT device, make sure you can connect and use your device before including it in your project proposal. Verify that you have done these steps by explaining how you validated that you could use that API or IoT Device. Then, explain how it will contribute to the solution of the original problem that we've identified.
    I am going to use an EDAMAM API. I went to their website and registered with them to acqurire          an Application ID: 6ae984d7, Application Key: 1e3f4cdfbcf700dd2a0fe5dd80c0487d	â€”
    It will contribute to my site by allowing the user to search through a database of recipes.

        - Deployment Method

    - You can come back and update your answer later, so don't overthink it. If you end up not using a tool, put down that you didn't use it and why.
